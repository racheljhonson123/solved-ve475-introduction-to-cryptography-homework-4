<strong>Ex. 4 —</strong><em> Prime vs. irreducible</em>

In a commutative ring R, a non-zero, non-invertible element p is said to be<em> prime</em> if for any x, y ∈ R,

pl(x.y)                         implies                            pix or ply.               (∗)

The goal of this exercise is to prove that this definition generalizes the definition of primality for integers, i.e., p ∈ Z is prime if

p &gt; 1 and a I p                           implies                          a = 1 or a = p.                   (∗∗)

<ol>

 <li>Prove that in an integral domain, i.e. a commutative ring in which the product of two nonzero elements is nonzero, any prime element (in the sense of (∗)) is irreducible.</li>

 <li>Prove that in Z any irreducible integer is prime in the classical sense (∗∗).</li>

 <li>Prove that for p ∈ Z, (∗∗) implies (∗).</li>

 <li>Conclude that (∗) and (∗∗) are equivalent for integers.</li>
